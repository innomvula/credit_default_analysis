# 📊 Taiwan Credit Default Analysis

## 🔹 Overview
This project analyzes credit card default risk using a dataset from Taiwan, containing demographic, financial, and payment history data. The objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of default based on key financial indicators.

## 🔹 Problem
Financial institutions face significant losses due to unpaid credit balances. Accurately predicting default risk helps banks make better lending decisions and reduce financial exposure.

## 🔹 Objective
Develop a predictive model to classify customers as either likely to **default** or **not default**, using historical financial and demographic data.

## 🔹 Key Steps
1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning** – Checked for missing values, outliers, and data distributions.
2. **Feature Engineering** – Processed categorical variables and derived meaningful insights from payment history.
3. **Model Training & Evaluation** – Trained multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) and optimized performance using precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
4. **Insights & Conclusions** – Identified key predictors of default risk, such as payment history and bill amounts.

## 🔹 Conclusions
- **Payment history trends** are the most significant predictors of default.
- Customers with **higher credit limits** tend to have lower default probabilities.
- Model achieved **high predictive accuracy** with well-tuned hyperparameters.
